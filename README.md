### Project Description:

Our program encrypts a message into an image file through different techniques that may then be decrypted when viewed through varying planes in Stegsolve. We implemented encryption across the random, red, green, blue, xor, and gray planes.

### Instructions:
The user should run make run with arguments with the following flags:  
[-] -i flag for input user image
[-] -t flag for output message mask text file
[-] -o flag for output image file name
[-] -m flag for mode (red, green, blue, xor, gray, random)
[-] -p flag for bit edited for relevant planes (red, green, blue, alpha)
[-] -a flag for text file containing message
The default input and output image file names are cat.png and output.png. The default mask text file name is messageMask.txt.
