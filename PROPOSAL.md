# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Ashley Zhu and Connor Yau
       
# Intentions:

Our program will encrypt a message into an image file that may then be decrypted when viewed through a plane in Stegsolve. We aim to implement encryption across all 37 different planes in Stegsolve. 
    
# Intended usage:

The user should run our program and will then be prompted to give an inputs for the message they would like to encrypt, the name of the image file they would like to encrypt this message into, and the Stegsolve pane they would like the message to be visible in.
